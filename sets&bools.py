"""Sets and Booleans"""

# Sets: unordered col. of unique elements
# constructed using set()function

x = set()
# We add to sests with the add() method
x.add(1)
print x

x.add(2)
printx

"""Sets only have unique elements. Cannot add the same thing twice."""
# adding 2 to x --> x.add(2) will not add two '2's; x remains {1,2}



"""Booleans: True/False. Also, 'None' --> used as a placeholder"""

# Set object to be a boolean
a = True
print a

# We can also use comparison operators to create booleans.

# Output is boolean: 1 > 2 --> False

# None placeholder
b = None
